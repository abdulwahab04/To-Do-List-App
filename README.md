## About

TaskTrack is a simple web app that works as a to-do list to help you keep track of tasks to be accomplished.

## Key Features

- Add multiple tasks which can be checked as completed, uncompleted, or deleted.
- Add custom deadlines with user prompts.
- Store and track task status in local storage so that refreshing or closing the app does not delete tasks.

## Technical Overview

CogniSign's technical architecture revolves around JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:

- **JavaScript:** Integrates user interactivity within the web app and links to the HTML file.
- **HTML:** Structures the webpage itself and the content. Consists of a series of elements that communicate with the browser on how to display the content.
- **CSS:** Styles and lays out the webpage by altering things such as font, color, size, spacing, and various other decorative features.
